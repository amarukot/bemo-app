      <h3>What is the purpose of the dental school interview? </h3>

      <p>
        Regardless of the format of dental school interview (e.g. CDA structured
        interview, MMI, or Panel interview), the purpose of the interview is
        rather straightforward and remains constant across the board: to assess
        the personality and Non-Cognitive Skills (NCSs) of the candidate.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        What are NCSs? By these we mean the following: Communication skills,
        interpersonal skills, ethical and moral decision making capacity,
        maturity, professionalism, sense of social responsibility, service to
        community, leadership, initiative, scholarship, ability to collaborate
        with others, conflict resolution skills, etc.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Research has shown that, although academic performance (i.e. GPA and DAT
        scores) is a great indicator of didactic abilities in the first and
        second years of dental school, it provides, however, a very poor
        predictive value when it comes to future clinical performance. In fact,
        research shows that, an effective interview process is the best
        indicator of future clinical performance in the upper years, as it gives
        insight into the characteristics of the candidate and whether or not
        there will be a likelihood of future behavioural problems (an issue that
        dental schools constantly encounter and struggle to overcome). For
        example, it has been shown that those candidates who are "conscientious"
        and "open to new experiences" perform more effectively in the third and
        fourth years of dental school studies, where the education takes place
        in a clinical setting for the most part.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, dental schools, much like other professional schools, have over
        the past decade spent a lot of resources to devise the most effective
        interview process that will give them insight into the NCSs of their
        future candidates. And of course, for Canadian dental schools the answer
        has been the Canadian Dental Association's structured interview or CDA
        structured interviews.{" "}
